  ### Updating your agent

  * Follow standard procedures to [update the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/update-net-agent).
  * If you're using a particularly old agent, review the list of major changes and procedures for [updating legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrade-legacy-net-agents).

  We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read more about [keeping your agent up to date](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent).
  See the New Relic .NET agent [EOL policy doc](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-eol-policy) for information about agent releases and support dates.
