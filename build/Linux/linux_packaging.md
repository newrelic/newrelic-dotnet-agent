# Linux Packaging

The Linux CoreCLR agent can be packaged into .rpm (for Red Hat/Centos/Oracle/SUSE systems) and/or .deb (for Debian/Ubuntu/Mint systems) packages using Docker.

1. From Visual Studio, build the FullAgent solution, `Release` or `Debug` depending on your needs.
2. In Powershell, from `build/Linux`:
      1. `docker compose build`
      2. `docker compose run build_rpm`
      3. `docker compose run build_deb`

Optional: sign the .rpm

1. `docker compose run -e GPG_KEYS=/keys/gpg.tar.bz2 build_rpm`

You can do ad hoc testing inside containers using the `test_debian` and/or `test_centos` services and `bash`.

     docker compose run test_debian bash
     docker compose run test_centos bash
