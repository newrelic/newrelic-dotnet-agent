# As of 18Apr2016 the company moved from hipchat to Slack.
# The contents of the rooms in hipchat were migrated to Slack,
# but there was a change of names.
#
# This function will torque-convert the hipchat room name to the Slack room
# name, as we can't easily find all callers.
#
# In the quick effort to convert to Slack,
# we had to remove the generation of HTML
# from the call sites, and just embed URLs,
# and rely on Slack for extracting those URLs.
