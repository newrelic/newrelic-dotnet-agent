Usage: installAgent.ps1 -Destination "<path>" -InstallType (local|global) -LicenseKey <licenseKey> \
                        [-AppName "<yourApplicationName>" -LogDir "<pathToCustomLogLocation>"]

-Destination "<path>" 
    (Required) The location where the agent will be installed. May be an absolute or relative path.
    Wrapping quotes are also required.

-InstallType <local|global>
    (Required) Determines whether this is a local or global install. Local installs are the recommended
    installation type. With local installs you will need to set the necessary agent related
    environment variables when running your .Net Core 2.0 process.

    A global install will set machine level environment variables related to the agent as part of the
    install. However, doing so will result in the .NET Core 2.0 agent attempting to instrument all
    .Net Core 2.0 applications running on your system.

	If you decide to perform a global install of the agent, we recommend that you install the 64 bit
	version of the agent (default) and not the 32 bit version.

-LicenseKey <licenseKey>
    (Required) The license key associated with your New Relic account.

-AppName "<application Name>"
    (Optional) Sets the default application name associated with your agent installation.

-LogDir "<path>"
    (Optional) Sets a custom logging location for the agent. By default logs directory is located in the 
    install directory.

-X86
    (Optional) Installs the 32-bit version of the agent rather than the 64bit version. We do not recommend 
    installing the 32-bit version of the agent globally.

-ResetIIS
    (Optional) Performs an IISRESET after the installation has completed. This is only appropriate in the
	case where your .Net Core app is being hosted using IIS as a reverse proxy via the AspNetCoreModule.

-Force
    (Optional) Force the installation process to overwrite a previous install or install into an existing 
    folder. Doing so will overwrite any configuration customizations.  We recommend backing up your 
    configuration file and any custom instrumentation files prior to forcing an over-install.

-Help
    (Optional) Displays usage information for this script.
