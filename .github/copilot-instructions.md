- Always use the latest C# features and syntax.
- Use the latest C# language version available in the project.
- Ensure all files include the standard license header at the top.
- When writing unit tests, always use modern NUnit assertions.
- We use JustMock.Lite, so use only mock configurations that are valid for that package.
- Always include the required usings at the top of the file.
- Do not use reflection in unit tests to access private members of the class under test.
- Always add [Teardown] attributes to the test class and test methods, respectively, when the test class uses disposable resources in the [Setup] method.
