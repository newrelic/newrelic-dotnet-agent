Things that could use better composite test coverage:

* Transaction-level metrics (e.g. HttpDispatcher, WebTransaction, WebTransactionTotalTime, etc)
* Supportability metrics
* Transaction event details
* Transaction trace details
* Error trace details

Unfinished features that will benefit from composite test coverage:

* RUM
* Synthetics
* SQL instrumentation
* SQL Traces
* Explain plans
