# New Relic .NET Agent Sample - Docker (Ubuntu or Debian)

## Overview

This sample demonstrates running a .NET 7 Web API in a Ubuntu-based Docker container. The sample application is just the "default" application created 
by running `dotnet new webapi`.

The two important parts of this sample are installation of the New Relic .NET Agent and setting the required environment variables to enable the .NET Agent
to load and instrument the sample app. Refer to `Dockerfile` for details.

Note that this sample uses a Ubuntu-based Docker image; you could use a Debian-based image also, by changing the tag on the two `FROM` lines in
`Dockerfile` to reference `7.0` (or `7.0-bullseye-slim`). No other changes required are required.

## To run this sample:
1. Edit `Dockerfile` and replace `<your-new-relic-license-key>` with your New Relic license key.
2. Open a command prompt (or Powershell) and run:
     ```
     docker build . -t dotnet-agent-ubuntu
     docker run -d --name dotnet-agent-ubuntu -p 8080:80 dotnet-agent-ubuntu
     ```
3. Generate some traffic to the app by visiting http://localhost:8080/WeatherForecast
4. Log in to your New Relic account and look for the `weather-forecast-ubuntu` app on the APM Summary page (it can take a few minutes).
5. You can view the logs generated by the New Relic .NET Agent by viewing the `/app/logs` folder in the Docker container.
