# New Relic .NET Agent Sample - Docker (Alpine)

## Overview
This sample demonstrates running a .NET 7 Web API in an Alpine-based Docker container. The sample application is just the "default" application created 
by running `dotnet new webapi`.

The two important parts of this sample are installation of the New Relic .NET Agent and setting the required environment variables to enable the .NET Agent
to load and instrument the sample app. Refer to `Dockerfile` for details.

## To run this sample:
1. Edit `Dockerfile` and replace `<your-new-relic-license-key>` with your New Relic license key.
2. Open a command prompt (or Powershell) and run:
     ```
     docker build . -t dotnet-agent-alpine
     docker run -d --name dotnet-agent-alpine -p 8080:80 dotnet-agent-alpine
     ```
3. Generate some traffic to the app by visiting http://localhost:8080/WeatherForecast
4. Log in to your New Relic account and look for the `weather-forecast-alpine` app on the APM Summary page (it can take a few minutes).
5. You can view the logs generated by the New Relic .NET Agent by viewing the `/app/logs` folder in the Docker container.
